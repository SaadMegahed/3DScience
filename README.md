## Introduction
Welcome to 20.S947! This course is designed to progress students from beginners to confident users of modern 3D rendering software with a focus on biological and chemical scenes. The course will provide an overview of 3D modeling, realistic materials, and scene composition. By the end of the course, students will feel comfortable rendering realistic scenes for scientific figures, journal covers, presentations, and community outreach. 

While the course will be offered in person, all lectures will also be provided asynchronously to fit a wide range of schedules. In addition, the class will follow a live demo format, where students can follow along and ask questions as they familiarize themselves with increasingly complex scenes. The course will use Blender, the leading open-source software for 3D rendering, used across science, animation, video game development, and virtual reality.

### JAN 23, 2023 - 10:30-11:30AM
#### Scene Composition
In this class, we will draw from the previous class and compose and render a 3D biological scene as if it were a journal cover.
* Importing a protein structure - 10 min
* Environmental lighting - 10 min
* Realistic textures - 10 min
* Scene composition - 10 min
* Preparing and rendering the scene - 10 min

### JAN 25, 2023 - 10:30-11:30AM
#### Movies and Animations
In this final class, we will render a movie of two proteins binding using cinematic lighting and compositing effects.
